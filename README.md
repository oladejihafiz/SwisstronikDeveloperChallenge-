# Sample Voting Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

Contract deployed to: https://explorer-evm.testnet.swisstronik.com/address/0xC7cA8CDC54d99BFd106BB85ab82c04C39915f0Fd
